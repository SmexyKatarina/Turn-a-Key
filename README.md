The idea behind this module is to be a needy Turn The Key module, instead of using a car engine slot like the original module does, it is a key for a doorknob instead. Unlike TTK, it should be turned based on the timer on the needy, instead of the bomb's timer, and the time it must be turned would be labeled on the key handle, meaning you must rotate the bomb to see the time you need to turn it.
I also had the idea the key could hang from the module, meaning the player could pick it up and click the knob to insert the key into the slot, but this functionality is not necessary.
